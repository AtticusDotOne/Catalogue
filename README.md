Integrated Ricardian Smart Contract Templates

## Description

Ricardian Smart Contract Templates for the purpose of integrating with the Atticus system. The templates are bundled for free use as-is within the Atticus system.

## How Templates Work

Templates have 2 sets of parameters that are to be set:
1. Parties
1. Data Paramters

The body and code of the template must follow the Atticus notation for placeholders of aforementioned parameters.

During negotiation or assignment of contracts, the parameters will be set--once all is set and the contract is signed by both parties, the code can then be loaded onto the Smart Contract System (e.g. EOS).

Therefore, the template ought to be drafted without any hard-coded party names or values that are negotiable (e.g. amounts, schedule, etc).
